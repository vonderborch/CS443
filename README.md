# CS451
Project and a homework for CS451 (Introduction to Database Systems) at WSU taught by Sakire Arslan Ay during the Spring 2014 semester.

The SQL queries are meant to run on MS SQL Server, and the project (programmed in C# and .NET) interfaces with a SQL Server database (not provided because the file was too big).

HW4 (under the HW folder) is some SQL queries we were asked to perform on a provided dataset.

The project is a C# application that interfaces with the Yelp dataset ( http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge , the version we were provided contains only data for Pheonix, AZ, USA) and performs various queries on the dataset.
